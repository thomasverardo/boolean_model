    - We don't use hash table because with hash we can't look for prefixes --FATTO

    - maintaining multiple indexes can make insertion and modification more complex, 
        as you have to update both indexes. However, the tradeoff is often worth it 
        in terms of improved query performance.
        Inverted indexes are optimized for efficient querying, so it's usually 
        more important to optimize for fast search rather than fast insertion/modification.

    -  For terms with a large number of distinct postings lists, the hash table 
        can be replaced with a balanced tree to reduce the memory footprint and improve 
        lookup times.

    - my_dict = {(
        'my_key', [1, 2]):
            2: [4],
            3: [1, 6]
            }
        This will be the structure of our permuted index
