About Dataset
Context
This is a text-based dataset that can be used for Information Retrieval (IR). It is publicly available from the University of Glasgow (http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/test_collections/cisi/).

Content
The data were collected by the Centre for Inventions and Scientific Information ("CISI") and consist of text data about 1,460 documents and 112 associated queries. Its purpose is to be used to build models of information retrieval where a given query will return a list of document IDs relevant to the query. The file "CISI.REL" contains the correct list (ie. "gold standard" or "ground proof") of query-document matching and your model can be compared against this "gold standard" to see how it has performed.
